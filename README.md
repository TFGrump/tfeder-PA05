## General Overview
A place for my CS 425 project.   

I put this here in case my laptop decides it just wants to die and I have my back-up of my code.    

It is done for the most part; I have kinda made the flocking algorithm, and ode solvers (derive, euler, and midpoint), using the provided resources that are not included in this repo because they are not needed to show that I made/understand these two ideas.   

## Completed Tasks
1. Tasks in MyPhysicsEngine.cpp
    - Implemented the Derive function
    - Implemented the Euler function
    - Implemented the ode (midpoint) function
2. Tasks in MyChickenAgent.cpp
    - Implemented compute_flocking_force function
    - Implemented compute_obstacle_avoidance_force
    - Implemented compute_following_force
3. I have made a video that is in the submission folder on Blackboard.
