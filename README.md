A place for my CS 425 project.   

I put this here in case my laptop decides it just wants to die and I have my back-up of my code.    

It is done for the most part; I have kinda made the flocking algorithm, and ode solvers (derive, euler, and midpoint), using the provided resources that are not included in this repo because they are not needed to show that I made/understand these two ideas.
