## General Overview
A place for my CS 425 project.   

I put this here in case my laptop decides it just wants to die and I have my back-up of my code.    

It is done for the most part; I have kinda made the flocking algorithm, and ode solvers (derive, euler, and midpoint), using the provided resources that are not included in this repo because they are not needed to show that I made/understand these two ideas.   

## Completed Tasks
1. Tasks in MyPhysicsEngine.cpp
    - Implemented the Derive function
    - Implemented the Euler function
    - Implemented the ode (midpoint) function
2. Tasks in MyChickenAgent.cpp
    - Implemented compute_flocking_force function
    - Implemented compute_obstacle_avoidance_force
    - Implemented compute_following_force
3. I have made a video that is in the submission folder on Blackboard.

Side note: Let me know if I need to take this repo down for honor code stuff (even though I am pretty sure that the only people who can see it is you and I since I made it private and invited you to the repo). I just needed a spot to put my work incase my laptop, or VS, decided to wanted to crash and I lose my work. I also would think that this would also save you some space when you are downloading projects since it is only three files instead of many more that you arlready have. There is still the submission on Blackboard just in case something happens to this repo.
